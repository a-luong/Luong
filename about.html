            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently in my first semester in the Computer Programming program at <i>Humber College.</i>I was previously enrolled in the Human Resources degree at <i>York University</i>; however, I realized my passion was in computer programming and decided to switch programs.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>My favourite thing to do is spending time with my two dogs. Aside from spending time with my dogs, I enjoy playing video games. Although I don't have as much time to play recently, you can find some of my favourite games by clicking the button below!</p>
